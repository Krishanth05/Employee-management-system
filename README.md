# Employee Attendance Tracker

**Simplify Employee Attendance Management with Unique IDs**

The Employee Attendance Tracker is a straightforward solution designed to make employee attendance management more efficient. It provides administrators with a simple way to assign unique IDs to employees for attendance recording.

## How it Works

- **Administrator-Friendly**: The system empowers administrators or managers, acting as the "root user," to input essential employee details.
